Description: Virtualized, isolated total-system testing
 The debmarshal testing framework is designed to simplify testing of
 total systems and multiple systems. To run a debmarshal test suite,
 the entire environment under test (including necessary dependencies)
 is created in a series of virtual machines, which can then be safely
 tested and abused.

Description: Provides Debian archive servers to Debmarshal virtual clients
 This package provides a pass through proxy to Debmarshal clients, so
 they can directly access ftp.us.debian.org as if they
 were directly connected to the internet.  As an alternative to this, you
 can have a local mirror, possibly debmarshal-managed for offline or
 testing against particular releases.
