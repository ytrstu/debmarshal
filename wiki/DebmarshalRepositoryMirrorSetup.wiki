= Introduction =

This is a simple setup to mirror and upstream Debian or Ubuntu repository, keeping snapshots and allowing aliases to be kept.

This is a prerequisite to having a repository of your own directly supervised packages, which will have dependencies on the mirrored archive.

=== Allocate archive space ===

Make sure /var/lib/debmarshal has sufficient space.  Allocate at least 40G per distribution and architecture, and probably its own filesystem so it can't fill /var.
If one of your mirrors is rapidly changing, you'll need lots of diskspace.

=== Create debmarshal user ===

A separate user will download and verify packages, and later maintain the upload queue and
distribution tracks.

{{{
adduser --disabled-login debmarshal
}}}

=== Install debmirror and gnupg ===

{{{
aptitude install debmirror gnupg
}}}

=== Add repository keys ===

{{{
aptitude install debian-archive-keyring
su - debmarshal
gpg --import /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
gpg --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv-key 55BE302B F42584E6
gpg --list-keys
cd .gnupg
cp pubring.gpg trustedkeys.gpg
}}}

Verify and modify trust using =gpg= with your web of trust as best you can.

=== Archive pull ===

Make sure archive pulls are working first, before setting up the debmarshal portion of the archive.
