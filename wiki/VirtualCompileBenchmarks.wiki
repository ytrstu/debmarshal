#summary Compile-benchmarks on several virtualization engines

= Introduction =

Often the slowest part of a test run is building the test source under a protected virtualization layer.  This benchmark is to configure and compile about 14M of C source code on Debian/lenny i386.  This typically takes on the order of a minute and fits in a relatively small VM, and even on very underpowered host systems under heavy virtualization is likely to finish in an hour or so.  Single and multithreaded builds (make -j2) are recorded, and multiple host root filesystem and other options are compared as the particular VM allows.

^1^ - Lenovo Thinkpad T60p, 2G, 2.17GHz Core Duo, Debian/sid 2009-07.  host FS is on a LUKS encrypted partition

^2^ - Intel G945 1.6GHz

^3^ - HP T4300 Core2 Quad 3.4 GHz, x86_64

^10^ - `mkdir lenny ; debootstrap _args_ lenny ; chroot lenny /bin/bash`

^11^ - `dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M seek=1000 count=0 of=lenny.ext3 ; mkfs -t ext3 -F lenny.ext3 ; mkdir lenny ; mount -o loop lenny.ext3 lenny`

^20^ - very unexpected that host filesystem is typically slower than loopback
