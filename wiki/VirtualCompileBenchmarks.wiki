#summary Compile-benchmarks on several virtualization engines

= Introduction =

Often the slowest part of a test run is building the test source under a protected virtualization layer.  This benchmark is to configure and compile about 14M of C source code on Debian/lenny i386.  This typically takes on the order of a minute and fits in a relatively small VM, and even on very underpowered host systems under heavy virtualization is likely to finish in an hour or so.  Single and multithreaded builds (make -j2) are recorded, and multiple host root filesystem and other options are compared as the particular VM allows.

^1^ - Lenovo Thinkpad T60p, 2G, 2.17GHz Core Duo, 2.6.30 Debian/sid 2009-07.  host FS is on a LUKS encrypted partition

^2^ - Intel G945 1.6GHz, 2.6.26 Debian/lenny.  Host FS is unencrypted 1TB 7200rpm drive

^3^ - HP T4300 Core2 Quad 3.4 GHz, Ubuntu/hardy 2.6.24 x86_64 host

^a^ - `mkdir lenny ; debootstrap _args_ lenny ; chroot lenny /bin/bash`

^b^ - `dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M seek=1000 count=0 of=lenny.ext3 ; mkfs -t ext3 -F lenny.ext3 ; mkdir lenny ; mount -o loop lenny.ext3 lenny`

^c^ - `qemu -m 256M -hda lenny.ext3 -net nic -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no -kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.30-1-686 -initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.30-1-686 -append root=/dev/hda`

^A^ - very unexpected that host filesystem is typically slower than loopback

^B^ - not actually chrooted, build timed in native Debian/lenny OS.
