Debmarshal is a Debian repository management system.  It is designed to manage a set of local release tracks of modified and additional packages on top of a full public repository (eg. Debian/sid, Ubuntu/dapper, ...).  The local database is Berkeley DB for speed.  Packaged file overlaps and undeclared dependency problems can be detected.  Multiple labels and permanent numbered snapshots are a feature of debmarshal managed repositories.
